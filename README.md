# HACKER STATISTICS
The project is to iterate through a number steps to get to the top of a 60 stairs building
using a random die 
if the die falls on a number less than 2, you go down a step of one 
if the die falls between 3 and 5 you go up one 
else you go up on a random number between 1 and 6
and calculate probability of doing so in under 60 steps
